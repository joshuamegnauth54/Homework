Wickham's paper introducing tidy data may be found [here](https://github.com/hadley/tidy-data/blob/master/tidy-data.tex). This concept provides a standardized way to view and use data. Data that has been tidied is easier to work with as tools are designed around the tidy format.\n",

Melting datasets collapses columns into variables and values. Melting a dataset may initially seem terrifying because of the radical changes that occur. However, the process is easy to grok once seen in action.\n",

    "So, melt collapses the columns passed to value_vars (or the columns _not_ passed to id_vars is value_vars is None). The column names becomes the values of the new column which is given the name passed to var_name. The values are the values from the value_vars columns which are matched to the var_name column. This is hard to explain and the concept was confusing at first. Keep the above in mind when looking at the melted DataFrame below."
