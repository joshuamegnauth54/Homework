    "Cleaning datasets consumes a large part of a data scientist's time as we discussed in the notes. **Tidy data** is a concept developed by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/). You can read Wickham's paper introducing tidy data [here as LaTex](https://github.com/hadley/tidy-data/blob/master/tidy-data.tex) or [here as a PDF](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf). This concept provides a standardized way to view and use data. Tidy data is generally easier to analyze due to the proliferation of tools that work with the tidy format.\n",

The activity variable is split into multiple columns. Well, multiple is a bit of a misnomer. Activity is split into **more than fifty columns**!\n",

More importantly, the values of the time variable are encoded as strings in the format **hours:minutes**. Analyzing data encoded in that way is impossible to analyze directly. Instead, the strings must be parsed and processed.\n",

The column title \"GEO/ACL00\" is egregious by the fact that is extremely annoying to type, code completion aside. The dataset has a \"Total\" column which indicates that the times for the activities add up to 24 hours (or at least _should_). The \"Total\" column is useful to note missing data. However, the dataset is missing values so I'm not entirely sure if the column has a purpose."

    "The function [pandas.melt](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.melt.html) solves our first major problem simply and effectively. Melting datasets collapses columns into variables and values. Melting a dataset may initially seem terrifying because of the radical changes that occur. However, the process is easy to grok once seen in action.\n",

    "So, melt collapses the columns passed to value_vars (or the columns _not_ passed to id_vars is value_vars is None). The column names becomes the values of the new column which is given the name passed to var_name. The values are the values from the value_vars columns which are matched to the var_name column. This is hard to explain and the concept was confusing at first. Keep the above in mind when looking at the melted DataFrame below."
