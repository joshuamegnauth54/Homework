# What is Markdown?

[Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) is a simple and efficient [markup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language) language designed for technical documents.

Markup languages provide small syntaxes that "markup" documents to indicate elements of presentation. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a salient example of markup. [Media Wiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) (Wikipedia and others) defines a [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Markup_Language) for editors to easily edit pages.  

## What does that even mean?

Markdown is *simple* and *efficient* because a writer (id est, you) is able to focus on producing content rather than being impeded by operational details. As a quick example we can look at *bolding* or _italicizing_ text. Bolding text in office suites, such as the open source [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) or Microsoft Office, involves either pressing a button with your mouse _or_ using a keyboard shortcut such as _Ctrl-B_. [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) requires subcommands in order to bold which looks a tad less tidy than Markdown.

Bolding in Markdown is as simple as surrounding text with two pairs of asterisks or two pairs of underscores:

```
**Josh likes cats.**  
__Josh likes coffee.__
```

This produces:

**Josh likes cats.**  
__Josh likes coffee.__

Easy, right? Markdown (as well as LaTeX) follows the principle of _not_ distracting the writer from their content with extravagent user interfaces and incessant clicking. Ultimately, Markdown leads to efficient and effacious technical document production despite having a learning curve in comparison to office suites.

The second major quality is Markdown's focus on *technical documents*. Technical documents are reports such as theses. Entire books have been written entirely in Markdown. Hadley Wickham is a prominent R programmer who has written and contributed to salient libraries---notably [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) as well as the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org/). Wickham's well-known, free, and open source text [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Introduction.html) as well as his [R For Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) were written in Markdown.

>"The book is written in RMarkdown with bookdown. It is automatically rebuilt from source by travis. R4DS is a collaborative effort and many people have >contributed fixes and improvements via pull request."

Markdown allows _embedded_ and _syntax highlighted_ code blocks as well as LaTeX style mathematics symbols. Both of the aforementioned features vastly ease writing technical documents. Copying and pasting code to office suites is a task for masochists. Math often requires cumbersome extensions to properly use in G Suite or Microsoft Office. Office suites have strengths and pros, such as their ease of use---but Markdown and LaTeX are tools designed by and for scientists and engineers.

Anywho. Let's jump into Markdown! I will introduce some but not all features in the following sections. Consider this guide as a bootstrap after which you may look up whatever else you wish to do with Markdown with ease. I recommend [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) which is, in fact, totally definitive.
