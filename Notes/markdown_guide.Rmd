# What is Markdown?

[Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) is a simple and efficient scripting language for technical documents.

Markdown is *simple* and *efficient* because a writer (id est, you) is able to focus on producing content rather than being impeded by technical details. As a quick example we can look at *bolding* or _italicizing_ text. Bolding text in office suites, such as the open source [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) or Microsoft Office, involves either pressing a button with your mouse _or_ using a keyboard shortcut such as _Ctrl-B_. [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) requires subcommands in order to bold.

Bolding in Markdown is as simple as surrounding text with asterisks:

```
*Josh likes cats.*
```

This produces:

*Josh likes cats.*

Easy, right? Markdown (as well as LaTeX) follow the principle of _not_ distracting the writer from their content with extravagent user interfaces and incessant clicking. Ultimately, Markdown leads to efficient and effacious technical document production.

The second major quality is Markdown's focus on *technical documents*. Technical documents are reports such as theses. Entire books have been written entirely in Markdown. Hadley Wickham is a prominent R programmer who has written and contributed to salient libraries . Wickham's well-known, free, and open source text [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Introduction.html) as well as his [R For Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) were written in Markdown.
