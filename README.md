# Miscellaneous

What is this repository?

**I don't know.**

I intend to use my _Miscellaneous_ repo to backup code or store random junk. I'm storing the _Markdown_ files for notes here until I have enough that I feel sufficiently comfortable in creating a _Notes_ repository.

To clarify: You shouldn't use anything in this repository, ever.

## Full disclosure---code provenance

My repository contains a mix of code I wrote completely on my own as well as code written while following tutorials.

The tutorials/books include:

* [Michael Snoyman's](https://snoyman.com) excellent, accelerated Rust tutorials.
* The [Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book) book.
* Probably the [Rust Cookbook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook) too.
