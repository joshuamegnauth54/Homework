# Miscellaneous

What is this repository?

**I don't know.**

I intend to use my _Miscellaneous_ repo to backup code or store random junk. I'm storing the _Markdown_ files for notes here until I have enough that I feel sufficiently comfortable in creating a _Notes_ repository.

I'll probably also back up code I've written while following tutorials as to at least have a backup.

Maybe I should rename this repository to **back up!**
